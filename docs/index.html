                                    New Leaf Radio is a site that is a dedicated source for Animal Crossing music 24/7. The site will play tracks from the popular series Animal Crossing
                                    based on the the current hour reported by your browser. New Leaf Radio now supports tracks from New Horizons! Yeah that's a whole two games in this beast! Its
                                    various tracks are sourced from those available on Youtube (see <a href="credit.html">Credits for more details</a>) for free. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We avoid monetization because I didn't compose these, I didn't do any of the work to get them out of the game, or anything besides make this lil' site here. 
                                    If you do feel so inclined to support the original developer, there is a "Buy me a Coffee" link on the radio page. This won't affect how the site is supported or treated, 
                                    since it will always be a cute little hobby to maintain; you'll just be sending a coffee :) (Fun fact: Developers do, in fact, run largely on coffee)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Thanks to the hosting here on GitHub, this site will be around 24/7, 365 days a year, and for the forseeable future. I don't plan to every monetize
                                    the site at this time and want to leave it as accessible to the general public as possible
                                </p>
                                <h4>

                                    The websites runs on GitHub Pages.
                                    Besides that little more is really done server side and keeping it light helps make the load on it low (with free hosting that's a must!)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The frontend is vanilla html supported by Bootstrap. It helps make a modern-looking and attractive website
                                    without the overhead of recreating the wheel on various components. It is very much mobile-first and its support of breakpoint
                                    classes allows any developer ample support to creating a responsive webpage.
                                </p>

                                    The key feature that makes this project stand out from similar ventures like this is the integration of dynamic weather support. Leveraging a 
                                    public api hosted by the National Weather Service and the built in browser functions for geoLocation, we can determine a client's 
                                    nearest weather station and determine the category of precipitation. Using that data, we can play music whose ambience matches what's 
                                    right outside their window! Wowzers!
                                </p>

                                    The songs are hosted on IPFS to make distribution easier and not rely on any CDN. You can support the project by pinning the following CID on your IPFS Node: QmU8r6FoSr6YLaNCSn1yYVXoAcrEoM5pLNCYVqx8tCXFhA
