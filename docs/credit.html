                                    The original website was made by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Terrible_At_Games/">Terrible_At_Games</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://newleafradio.glitch.me/">newleafradio.glitch.me</a>.
                                    Glitch suspends websites that are not updated regularly so I uploaded it to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lhns/newleafradio">GitHub</a> and made a few adjustments.

                                    Rather than rip the loopable tracks straight from the game, their mp3's were gathered from the youtube channel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JezDayy/videos">Jez</a> 
                                    run by JezDayy. Seriously check out their channel. Their work involves way more than just extending Animal Crossing audio and I've personally checked out their channel in
                                    the past for music to use for studying (especially the raining tracks).

                                <p>
                                    I plan to never feature their personal works here as I would hate to steal their work and rob them of 
                                    any monetization that comes from watching works that they have personally compiled/composed themselves. What will be here are just the extended tracks featured from their 
                                    channel.
                                </p>

                                  Tracks for the New Horizons soundtrack option were collected from the playlist created by Cevan located <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GhhV_WGsa0&amp;list=PL47a1Ou5h81Ph3JrI7TIcJljA_N4nCX1s">here</a>.
                                  I really do suggest that you check out their channel personally. They have a lot of the original soundtrack available, even extending to the cool new tracks for all the different museum exhibits!

                                  To add the rain background noise for the New Horizon soundtracks, I collected and overlayed some simple rain ambience on the original audio. If you are interested in this track by itself or
                                  want to listen to more relaxing music to chill out to, you can find their channel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy-8O3EF3pLXBt7C5D9aiAg">here</a>.
